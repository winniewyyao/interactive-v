A small interactive project I made for my partner as a gift for Chinese Valentine's Day.

Chinese Valentine's Day, also known as ChiSi Festival, falls on the 7th day of the 7th lunar month, which is August 29 in 2025. 

The festival is inspired by a Chinese legend â€“ Niulang (the cowherd) and Zhinu (the weaver girl) are star-crossed lovers who meet once a year on a magical bridge in the sky.
